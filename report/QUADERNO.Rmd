##SET UP

We started by creating a specific script for setting up our software for the analysis, choosing and loading the required packages


```{r libraries}
#LIBRARIES----
library(tidyverse)
library(rio)
library(stringr)
library(xml2)
library(httr)
library(RCurl)
library(qdapRegex)
library(rvest)
library(lubridate)
library(stargazer)
library(kableExtra)
library(plotly)
library(tm)
library(syuzhet)
```


We imported the "parl_gov" dataset and filtered it for observations about Italy.
We needed to add variables to this base dataframe and looked for them on Wikipedia, we scraped the Wikipedia pages for each and every one of the Italian republican governments with a for-loop.
This allowed us to gather a second dataframe with the referral links and the dimission dates of the cabinets.
We then merged the scraped df with our original one.
We scraped another webpage from Wikipedia containing a useful table with all the infos about the exact lengths of the Italian govs, and merged it too in our main df.
We performed multiple operations to manage and clean our data and ended up with "Italy", our final polished dataset.

##PHASE 1 - ANALYSIS

We went on with our analysis starting from the visualization of our data.
First, we wanted compare the crisis time between each government and the averages and highlights of the Italian cabinets.
Our variables are "tot_days" which counts the total days of length of a given cabinet from the day of its oath to the oath of the next one.
"real_days", which counts the days of a cabinet from oath date to resignation date.
And "crisis_days" which counts the difference between "tot" and "real", and basically represents the crisis period of the executive.
We found out that, on average, Italian cabinets tend to last a little more than one year (376.8 days). This data would be even worse for the so called "Prima Repubblica" period (1946-1994), the average time of the subsequent governments is almost doubled (1994-today).
The record for the longest executive is currently 1412 (with only three crisis days) and it is held by the Berlusconi II cabinet; while the shortest is 22 days (with 11 crisis days) and it is held by the Fanfani I cabinet. 
Italy spent 2364 days in office for current affairs in total (and counting).



```{r  results = "asis", fig.align= "center" }
stargazer(summarize(italy, crisis_days, tot_days, real_days), type = "html", nobs = FALSE, mean.sd = TRUE, median = TRUE, iqr = TRUE) 
```




We wanted to give an overview of the Italian republican history and its numerous governments and we plotted it in a time-line.
The line shows the sequence of the cabinets and the nature of their establishment: confirmation of the exiting majority, new majority, new elected legislature, early elections, or technocratic government. 


```{r timeline}

```

```{r plot_timeline, results = TRUE, fig.width = 10}
print(timeline_plot)
#ggplotly(timeline_plot)


```


This pie-chart shows the proportions of such outcomes.
A confirmation of the exiting majority with a government reshuffle is the most common outcome of an Italian government crisis: basically the ministers change but the majority coalition remains unchanged. 
Similarly often a new majority is crafted without calling for new elections: a new government coalition within the same legislature, this is what recently happened in 2019 with the shift form the first and second iteration of the "Conte" cabinet and it just happened again with the installation of Mario Draghi's cabinet.

The high instability of the italian majorities led too several early election turn, making this practice very common both in the "Prima" and "Seconda Repubblica".
Three times (we could say four, counting the current one) in republican history a technocratic government establishment was necessary, with Dini in 1995 , Ciampi in 1993, and Monti in 2011.


```{r visual_analysis}
#summaries----
summary(italy$tot_days)

summary(italy$real_days)

summary(italy$crisis_days)

sum(italy$crisis_days)

stargazer(italy$tot_days, type = 'latex')
#piechart----
conta <- count(italy, outcomes) 
conta

dev.off()
```

```{r pie_visual_analysis, results = TRUE}
# Basic piechart
ggplot(conta, aes(x="", y=n, fill=outcomes)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color="white") +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  theme_void() # remove background, grid, numeric labels


```


In order to show the differences in duration between the Italian governments we plotted the time-spans of the 66 executives.
The graph properly shows the behaviour of Italian republican democracy and its instability and tendency to short governments and legislatures (66 cabinets in 75 years).
There could be, however, a new pattern towards slightly longer executives started in the 90' with the "Seconda Repubblica", all of the spikes of our graph are in fact grouped to the right side ( circa 1994 to today).


```{r plot_visual_analysis_1, results = TRUE}
#Time line days plot----

time_line2 <- ggplot(italy, aes(x = start_date, y = real_days, label = cabinet_name)) +
  geom_line(color = "orange") + 
  geom_point(color = "black") +
  scale_y_continuous() +
  ggtitle("Government duration during years")+
  ylab("Real days") +
  xlab("Date") + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
ggplotly(time_line2)  

```


With such an high number of governments comes an almost equally great number of governments crisis; these periods spent "in office for current affairs" show great differences within one another.
We saw that the average crisis lasts 35 days, but Italy has reached peaks of 128 days without a proper government coalition.
However, most of the highest bars in our graph are in correspondence of new elections and consequents electoral campaigns, both for natural end of the legislature and for the call to early elections.



```{r plot_visual_analysis_2, results = TRUE}
#Crisis Days plot----
g1 <- ggplot(italy, aes(x = ID, y = crisis_days, label = cabinet_name)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkblue") +
    scale_y_continuous() +
    ggtitle("Crisis days")+
    ylab("Days") +
    xlab("")+
    theme_bw()+
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")


points_to_label <- c("Dini I", "Monti", "Andreotti V", "Andreotti I", "Ciampi", "Gentiloni")

g2 <- g1 + 
  geom_text(aes(ID,  crisis_days, label = cabinet_name), data = italy[italy$cabinet_name %in% points_to_label, ]) 

ggplotly(g2)  

```

##PHASE 2 - CARETAKERS

In light of our analysis of the Italian history and situation we wanted to compare it with similar political realities, a.i Europe.
Is Italian instability an anomaly? Is it common for a contemporary democracy to recur to caretaker cabinets as an instrument to handle crisis and emergencies?

In order to do so, we had to fetch new data, and create a new table to work with; we were helped by McDonnel and Valbruzzi's paper "Defining and classifying technocrat-led and technocratic governments" (2014).
We scraped four very useful tables from this source and merged them into a new working DF.

Our new dataset contained a simple profile of every caretaker government that has been installed in Europe in the last century; who was the prime minister, the percentage of technicians as ministers, the duration and of course, the country and year.

We added one more variable ourselves, the "triggers" that led to caretaking or technocratic cabinets.
We grouped these triggers in three macro-groups: "internal reasons", "post-communism transition" and "global debt crisis".
These three classifications are of course a form of over-simplification but allow us to see how these particular cabinets were very common in two very specific periods of time. 
Many Countries formerly belonging to the sovietic sphere of influence adopted technocratic cabinets in the '90s, even multiple times. 
Something similar happened to many european countries two decades later with the global economic crisis.
Most of our observations were however due to "internal reasons", political scandals and other issues are in fact another important trigger, often registered in Europe (Italy's Ciampi cabinet is an example).

Italy has already adopted a new technocratic led partisan government with Draghi in 2021, and what history seems to suggest is that our country could not be the only one; The Covid-19 pandemics has triggered a period of renewed economic instability and technicians could be required in many different realities both to handle the emergency and, as in the Italian case, put in action an investment plan using the money provided by the European Union through the Next Generation EU program.
However, such hypothesis should be further analysed and checked through economic instruments of control which were not the focus of our project.

This bar-chart allowed us to have a graphical representation of the "timings" of caretakers/technocracies in Europe.




```{r caretaker_comp}
#CARETAKER COMP
#import dataset----
#following datasets have been scaped and exported into CSV files in script 04
techn <- rio::import(here::here("dataset", "EU_Tech_Govs.csv"))

reforms <- rio::import(here::here("dataset", "Tech_gov_Economics.csv"))

#triggers setting----

trigger_for_technocracy<- c("post-communism transition","post-communism transition", "global debt crisis","global debt crisis", "post-communism transition", "internal reasons", "internal reasons", "internal reasons", "internal reasons", "global debt crisis", "global debt crisis", "internal reasons", "internal reasons", "global debt crisis", "internal reasons", "internal reasons", "global debt crisis", "internal reasons", "internal reasons", "post-communism transition","post-communism transition","post-communism transition","post-communism transition","post-communism transition")
trigger_for_technocracy<-as.data.frame(trigger_for_technocracy)

#merging datasets----
techn<-arrange(techn,(state))

trigger_for_technocracy<-tibble::rowid_to_column(trigger_for_technocracy, "ID")
techn<-tibble::rowid_to_column(techn, "ID")
techn_comp<-merge(trigger_for_technocracy, techn, by="ID")

#plot----
contaplot <- trigger_for_technocracy %>%
  group_by(trigger_for_technocracy) %>%
  summarise(count=n())

cols <- c("internal reasons"="gold1","post-communism transition"="firebrick2", "global debt crisis"="dodgerblue2")

plottacont <- ggplot(contaplot, aes(x=reorder(trigger_for_technocracy,-count),y=count, fill = trigger_for_technocracy)) +  
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab(" ") +
  ylab(" ") +
  ggtitle("Caretaking triggers") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cols)+
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

```{r triggersplot,  results = TRUE}
plottacont

```

Once we visualized "when" caretaker governments took place in Europe we wanted to see how they were distributed geographically.
The interactive map below shows the countries that adopted such measure and their respective frequencies.

```{r map}
#libraries----
library(ggmap)
library(mapdata)
library(maptools)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthdata)
library(rgeos)
#import coords dataset----
capmap<-read.csv(here::here ("dataset", "concap.csv"))
capmap<-dplyr::filter(capmap, capmap$ContinentName == "Europe")
capmap<- dplyr::rename(capmap, state = CountryName)

techmap<-merge(capmap, techn, by = "state")

#europe map-----

world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")
Europe <- world[which(world$continent == "Europe"),]
EU<-ggplot(Europe) +
  geom_sf() +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-25,50), ylim = c(35,70), expand = FALSE)

N<-c(3,3,3,2,2,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,3,3,2,2,5,5,5,5,5)
N<-as.data.frame(N)
N<-tibble::rowid_to_column(N, "ID")
#techmap<-tibble::rowid_to_column(techmap, "ID")
techmap_n<- merge.data.frame(N, techmap, by= "ID")

```

```{r plot_map, results = TRUE}
#map design----
Map1<-EU + geom_point(aes(x = CapitalLongitude, y = CapitalLatitude, label=state, label2 = N, label3 =tot_days), data = techmap_n, size = 2.5, color="red") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank()) + ylab("") + xlab("")
ggplotly(Map1)

```
What appears immediately clear from this map is that both caretakers and technocracies are something quite common in European democracies, even if it is a circumscribed phenomenon.
Eastern and southern countries have recurred to this "special" government types quite often, while the greater economic powers of central and northern Europe never had to in the last decades.

Even though defining a clear pattern and correlations between circumstances and the necessity of a caretaker government would be an immensely complex task, some deductions and mild hypothesis can be derived from the collocation in space and time of the European cases.
One could already intuitively think of a correlation between technocracies/caretakers and the urge to face an issue which is indeed "technical", and as such strictly related to the economic situation.
We decided to report here two of the tables that inspired our analysis, the variables they contain are a first step to understand the causality and nature of the governments in analysis.

```{r table1, results = 'asis'}

df <- rio::import(here::here("dataset", "Percentage_EU_Tech_Gov.csv"))
 
df %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling()
```
```{r table2, results = 'asis'}
fd <- rio::import(here::here("dataset", "Tech_Gov_Economics.csv"))
 
fd %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling()
```



##PHASE 3 NEWSPAPERS
The specificity of the countries and time periods that hosted caretaker governments immediately led us to think to some sort of dicotomy between the political establishments who neeeded them, and those who did not.
In order to check whether there were strong opinions towards this forms of government and the usually not "reassuring" circumstances that led to their installations we tried a little experiment.

We scraped the articles from a few foreign newspapers about two of the most important Italian government crisis, the ones that led to  Mario Monti's cabinet in 2011, and the most recent one which conducted to the establishment of a new majority led by Mario Draghi.
Unfortunately, we encountered several issues with the non-english articles (from LeMonde and Spiegel) and decided to only use the Guardian and BBC to perform our analysis. The Text analysis was quite a miss and a disappointment, nothing interesting emerged from it, the most used words were all only connected to mere "narration" rather than to proper opinions.
We decided then to try with a sentiment analysis which is reported below:
the results were a little more informative; "positive" and "trust" were the two emotions with the highest frequency along with "negative".
This actually makes sense when compared to what we red in both occasions on our national newspapers, the advent of technocracies is in fact compatible with a "negative" situation to begin with, but also with the necessity to be "positive" towards this solution and "trust" in the new highly competent cabinet. Both Monti and Draghi are perfect examples of  widely respected technicians even from an international point of view that were deemed trustworthy and capable from both national and foreign papers.

We wanted to further look into these two cabinets. 
The experience of the Monti government is, in fact, being recalled more than often in the recent days in order to compare it with the current Italian situation both for bad and for good.
Even if it is too soon to really judge and contrast this two very different and yet similar political establishments, we decided to venture in an earlier and simpler form of comparison starting with the two prime ministers inaugural speeches.
Before we do that it is important to point out the main differences between these two executives, being led by a strong technocratic component could be the only real similarity and a proper comparison of the operations they perform could be very difficult, or even inappropriate; Monti was a full technocratic government, Draghi is not, the new majority is "political", making this only a technocratic led partisan government.
However the almost unprecedented width of such majority makes it difficult to actually define the actual orientation of the government.
Both Monti and Draghi came into the scene as a form of "last resort" against very delicate and problematic economic situations, the circumstances are however hardly comparable mainly for the means and instruments at disposal of the two prime ministers.
Monti's one was a time of austerity, while Draghi's aims to be one for investments thanks to the fund provided by the EU through the "Next Generation EU" project.

Our text analysis of the two speeches shows evidence of this deep difference.

#DISCOURSE ANALYSIS
#Draghi's and Monti's texts----
Monti_disco<-c("Signor Presidente, onorevoli senatrici, onorevoli senatori, è con grande emozione che mi rivolgo a voi come primo atto del percorso rivolto ad ottenere la fiducia del Parlamento al Governo ieri costituito.
'emozione è accresciuta dal fatto che prendo oggi la parola per la prima volta in questa Aula nella quale mi avete riservato qualche giorno fa un'accoglienza che mi ha commosso. Sono onorato di entrare a far parte del Senato della Repubblica. Desidero rivolgere un saluto deferente al Capo dello Stato, presidente Napolitano che con grande saggezza, perizia e senso dello Stato ha saputo risolvere una situazione difficile in tempi ristrettissimi nell'interesse del Paese e di tutti i cittadini.

Vorrei anche rinnovargli la mia gratitudine per la fiducia accordata alla mia persona, per il sostegno e la partecipazione che mi ha costantemente assicurato nei miei sforzi per comporre un Governo che potesse soddisfare le richieste delle forze politiche e, al contempo, dare risposte efficaci alle gravi sfide che il nostro Paese ha di fronte a sé.
 
Rivolgo il mio saluto ai Presidenti emeriti della Repubblica, ai senatori a vita e a tutti i senatori. Mi auguro di poter stabilire con ciascuno di voi anche un rapporto personale come vostro collega, sia pure l'ultimo arrivato.

Il Parlamento è il cuore pulsante di ogni politica di Governo, lo snodo decisivo per il rilancio e il riscatto della vita democratica. Al Parlamento vanno riconosciute e rafforzate attraverso l'azione quotidiana di ciascuno di noi dignità, credibilità e autorevolezza.
Da parte mia, da parte nostra, vi sarà sempre una chiara difesa del ruolo di entrambe le Camere quali protagoniste del pubblico dibattito.
Un ringraziamento specifico e molto sentito desidero, infine, esprimere al vostro, al nostro, Presidente. Il presidente Schifani 

ha voluto accogliermi, fin dal primo istante di questa mia missione - come potete immaginare, non semplicissima - svoltasi, in gran parte, a Palazzo Giustiniani, con una generosità e una cordialità che non potrò dimenticare.

Rivolgo, infine, un pensiero rispettoso e cordiale al presidente, onorevole dottor Silvio Berlusconi  mio predecessore, del quale mi fa piacere riconoscere l'impegno nel facilitare in questi giorni la mia successione nell'incarico.
 
Il Governo riconosce di essere nato per affrontare in spirito costruttivo e unitario una situazione di seria emergenza. Vorrei usare questa espressione: Governo di impegno nazionale. Governo di impegno nazionale significa assumere su di sé il compito di rinsaldare le relazioni civili e istituzionali, fondandole sul senso dello Stato. È il senso dello Stato, è la forza delle istituzioni, che evitano la degenerazione del senso di famiglia in familismo, dell'appartenenza alla comunità di origine in localismo, del senso del partito in settarismo. Ed io ho inteso fin dal primo momento il mio servizio allo Stato non certo con la supponenza di chi, considerato tecnico, venga per dimostrare un'asserita superiorità della tecnica rispetto alla politica. Al contrario, spero che il mio Governo ed io potremo, nel periodo che ci è messo a disposizione, contribuire in modo rispettoso e con umiltà a riconciliare maggiormente - permettetemi di usare questa espressione - i cittadini e le istituzioni, i cittadini alla politica.

Io vorrei, noi vorremmo, aiutarvi tutti a superare una fase di dibattito, che fa parte naturalmente della vita democratica, molto, molto, accesa, e consentirci di prendere insieme, senza alcuna confusione delle responsabilità, provvedimenti all'altezza della situazione difficile che il Paese attraversa, ma con la fiducia che la politica che voi rappresentate sia sempre più riconosciuta, e di nuovo riconosciuta, come il motore del progresso del Paese.
 
Le difficoltà del momento attuale. L'Europa sta vivendo i giorni più difficili dagli anni del secondo dopoguerra. Il progetto che dobbiamo alla lungimiranza di grandi uomini politici, quali furono Konrad Adenauer, Jean Monnet, Robert Schuman e - sottolineo in modo particolare - Alcide De Gasperi e che per sessant'anni abbiamo perseguito, passo dopo passo, dal Trattato di Roma - non a caso di Roma - all'atto unico, ai Trattati di Maastricht e di Lisbona, è sottoposto alla prova più grave dalla sua fondazione.
 
Un fallimento non sarebbe solo deleterio per noi europei. Farebbe venire meno la prospettiva di un mondo più equilibrato in cui l'Europa possa meglio trasmettere i suoi valori ed esercitare il ruolo che ad essa compete, in un mondo sempre più bisognoso di una governance multilaterale efficace.
 
Non illudiamoci, onorevoli senatori, che il progetto europeo possa sopravvivere se dovesse fallire l'Unione Monetaria. La fine dell'euro disgregherebbe il mercato unico, le sue regole, le sue istituzioni. Ci riporterebbe là dove l'Europa era negli anni cinquanta.
 
La gestione della crisi ha risentito di un difetto di governance e, in prospettiva, dovrà essere superata con azioni a livello europeo. Ma solo se riusciremo ad evitare che qualcuno, con maggiore o minore fondamento, ci consideri l'anello debole dell'Europa, potremo ricominciare a contribuire a pieno titolo all'elaborazione di queste riforme europee. Altrimenti ci ritroveremo soci di un progetto che non avremo contribuito ad elaborare, ideato da Paesi che, pur avendo a cuore il futuro dell'Europa, hanno a cuore anche i lori interessi nazionali, tra i quali non c'è necessariamente una Italia forte.
 
Il futuro dell'euro dipende anche da ciò che farà l'Italia nelle prossime settimane, anche e non solo, ma anche. Gli investitori internazionali detengono quasi metà del nostro debito pubblico. Dobbiamo convincerli che abbiamo imboccato la strada di una riduzione graduale ma durevole del rapporto tra debito pubblico e prodotto interno lordo. Quel rapporto è oggi al medesimo livello al quale era vent'anni fa ed è il terzo più elevato tra i Paesi dell'OCSE. Per raggiungere questo obiettivo intendiamo far leva su tre pilastri: rigore di bilancio, crescita ed equità.
 
Nel ventennio trascorso l'Italia ha fatto molto per riportare in equilibrio i conti pubblici, sebbene alzando l'imposizione fiscale su lavoratori dipendenti e imprese, più che riducendo in modo permanente la spesa pubblica corrente. Tuttavia, quegli sforzi sono stati frustrati dalla mancanza di crescita. L'assenza di crescita ha annullato i sacrifici fatti. Dobbiamo porci obiettivi ambiziosi sul pareggio di bilancio, sulla discesa del rapporto tra debito e PIL. Ma non saremo credibili, neppure nel perseguimento e nel mantenimento di questi obiettivi, se non ricominceremo a crescere.
 
Ciò che occorre fare per ricominciare a crescere è noto da tempo. Gli studi dei migliori centri di ricerca italiani avevano individuato le misure necessarie molto prima che esse venissero recepite nei documenti che in questi mesi abbiamo ricevuto dalle istituzioni europee. Non c'è nessuna originalità europea nell'aver individuato ciò che l'Italia deve fare per crescere di più. È un problema del sistema italiano riuscire a decidere e poi ad attuare quanto noi italiani sapevamo bene fosse necessario per la nostra crescita.
 
Non vediamo i vincoli europei come imposizioni. Anzitutto permettetemi di dire, e me lo sentirete affermare spesso, che non c'è un loro e un noi. L'Europa siamo noi.

Quelli che poi ci vengono in un turbinio di messaggi, di lettere e di deliberazioni dalle istituzioni europee sono per lo più provvedimenti rivolti a rendere meno ingessata l'economia, a facilitare la nascita di nuove imprese e poi indurne la crescita, migliorare l'efficienza dei servizi offerti dalle amministrazioni pubbliche, favorire l'ingresso nel mondo del lavoro dei giovani e delle donne, le due grandi risorse sprecate del nostro Paese.

L'obiezione che spesso si oppone a queste misure è che esse servono, certo, ma nel breve periodo fanno poco per la crescita. È un'obiezione dietro la quale spesso si maschera - riconosciamolo - chi queste misure non vuole, non tanto perché non hanno effetti sulla crescita nel breve periodo (che è vero che non hanno), ma perché si teme che queste misure ledano gli interessi di qualcuno. Ma, evidentemente, più tardi si comincia, più tardi arriveranno i benefìci delle riforme. Ma, soprattutto, le scelte degli investitori che acquistano i nostri titoli pubblici sono guidate sì da convenienze finanziarie immediate, ma - mettiamocelo in testa - sono guidate anche dalle loro aspettative su come sarà l'Italia fra dieci o vent'anni, quando scadranno i titoli che acquistano oggi.
 
Quindi, non c'è iato la tra le cose che dobbiamo o fare oggi o avviare oggi, anche se avranno effetti lontani, perché anche gli investitori, che ci premiano o ci puniscono, agiscono oggi, ma guardano anche agli effetti lontani.
 
Riforme che hanno effetti anche graduali sulla crescita, influendo sulle aspettative degli investitori, possono riflettersi in una riduzione immediata dei tassi di interesse, con conseguenze positive sulla crescita stessa. I sacrifici necessari per ridurre il debito e per far ripartire la crescita dovranno essere equi. Maggiore sarà l'equità, più accettabili saranno quei provvedimenti e più ampia - mi auguro - sarà la maggioranza che in Parlamento riterrà di poterli sostenere. Equità significa chiedersi quale sia l'effetto delle riforme non solo sulle componenti relativamente forti della società, quelle che hanno la forza di associarsi, ma anche sui giovani e sulle donne. Dobbiamo renderci conto che, se falliremo e se non troveremo la necessaria unità di intenti, la spontanea evoluzione della crisi finanziaria ci sottoporrà tutti, ma soprattutto le fasce più deboli della popolazione, a condizioni ben più dure.
 
La crisi che stiamo vivendo è internazionale; questo è ovvio, ma conviene ripeterlo ogni volta, anche ad evitare demonizzazioni. È internazionale, lo sto dicendo a tutti. Ma l'Italia ne ha risentito in maniera particolare. Secondo la Commissione europea, al termine del prossimo anno il prodotto interno lordo dell'Italia sarebbe ancora quattro punti e mezzo al di sotto del livello raggiunto prima della crisi. Per la stessa data, l'area dell'euro nel suo complesso avrebbe invece recuperato la perdita di prodotto dovuta alla crisi. Francia e Germania raggiungerebbero il traguardo di riportarsi al livello precrisi nell'anno in corso. La relativa debolezza della nostra economia precede l'avvio della crisi.
 
Tra il 2001 e il 2007 il prodotto italiano è cresciuto di 6,7 punti percentuali, contro i 12 della media dell'area dell'euro, i 10,8 della Francia e gli 8,3 della Germania. I risultati sono deludenti al Nord come al Sud. E non vi propongo un paragone con la Cina o con altri Paesi emergenti, ma con i nostri colleghi ed amici stretti della zona euro. La crisi ha colpito più duramente i giovani. Ad esempio, nei 15 Paesi che componevano l'Unione europea fino al 2004, tra il 2007 e il 2010 il tasso di disoccupazione nella classe di età 15-24 anni è aumentato di cinque punti percentuali, in Italia di 7,6 punti percentuali.
 
Il nostro Paese rimane caratterizzato da profonde disparità territoriali. Il lungo periodo di bassa crescita e la crisi le hanno accentuate. Esiste una questione meridionale: infrastrutture, disoccupazione, innovazione, rispetto della legalità.

I problemi nel Mezzogiorno vanno affrontati non nella logica del chiedere di più, ma di una razionale modulazione delle risorse.
 
Esiste anche una questione settentrionale: costo della vita, delocalizzazione, nuove povertà, bassa natalità.
 
Il riequilibrio di bilancio, le riforme strutturali e la coesione territoriale richiedono piena e leale collaborazione tra i diversi livelli istituzionali.
 
Occorre riconoscere il valore costituzionale delle autonomie speciali, nel duplice binario della responsabilità e della reciprocità. 
 
In quest'ottica, per rispondere alla richiesta formulata dalle istituzioni territoriali che, devo dire, ho ascoltato con molta attenzione...
 
Se dovete fare una scelta - mi permetto di rivolgermi a tutti - ascoltate, non applaudite!

Non ripeterò l'importanza del valore costituzionale delle autonomie speciali, perché altrimenti arrivano di nuovo applausi; l'ho già detto e lo avete ascoltato.
 
In quest'ottica - come stavo dicendo - perrispondere alla richiesta formulata dalle istituzioni territoriali nel corso delle consultazioni, ho deciso di assumere direttamente in questa prima fase le competenze relative agli affari regionali. Spero in questo modo di manifestare una consapevolezza condivisa circa il fatto che il lavoro comune con le autonomie territoriali debba proseguire e rafforzarsi, nonostante le difficoltà dell'agenda economica. In tale prospettiva si dovrà operare senza indugio per un uso efficace dei fondi strutturali dell'Unione europea.
Sono consapevole che sarebbe un'ambizione eccessiva da parte mia e da parte nostra pretendere di risolvere in un arco di tempo limitato, qual è quello che ci separa dalla fine di questa legislatura, problemi che hanno origini profonde e che sono radicati in consuetudini e comportamenti consolidati. Ciò che si prefiggiamo di fare è impostare il lavoro, mettere a punto gli strumenti che permettano ai Governi che ci succederanno di proseguire un processo di cambiamento duraturo.
 
Per questo il programma che vi sottopongo oggi si compone di due parti, che hanno obiettivi ed orizzonti temporali diversi. Da un lato, vi è una serie di provvedimenti per affrontare l'emergenza, assicurare la sostenibilità della finanza pubblica, restituire fiducia nelle capacità del nostro Paese di reagire e sostenere una crescita duratura ed equilibrata. Dall'altro lato, si tratta di delineare con iniziative concrete un progetto per modernizzare le strutture economiche e sociali, in modo da ampliare le opportunità per le imprese, i giovani, le donne e tutti i cittadini, in un quadro di ritrovata coesione sociale e territoriale.
 
In considerazione dell'urgenza con la quale abbiamo dovuto operare per la formazione di questo Governo - ed in questo senso voglio ringraziare le diverse forze politiche che, nei miei confronti, figura estranea al vostro mondo, si sono gentilmente e con sollecitudine apprestate all'ascolto e all'offerta di contributi dei quali ho cercato di tenere conto - quello che intendo fare oggi è semplicemente presentarvi gli aspetti essenziali dell'azione che intendiamo svolgere. Se otterremo la fiducia del Parlamento, ciascun Ministro esporrà alle Commissioni parlamentari competenti le politiche attraverso le quali, nei singoli settori, queste azioni verranno avviate.
 
È in discussione in Parlamento una proposta di legge costituzionale per introdurre un vincolo di bilancio in pareggio per le amministrazioni pubbliche, in coerenza con gli impegni presi nell'ambito dell'Eurogruppo.
L'adozione di una regola di questo tipo può contribuire a mantenere nel tempo il pareggio di bilancio programmato per il 2013, evitando che i risultati conseguiti con intense azioni di risanamento vengano erosi negli anni successivi, come è accaduto in passato. Affinché il vincolo sia efficace, dovranno essere chiarite le responsabilità dei singoli livelli di Governo.
 
A questo proposito ed anche in considerazione della complessità della regola, ad esempio l'aggiustamento per il ciclo, sarà opportuno studiare l'esperienza di alcuni Paesi europei che hanno affidato ad autorità indipendenti la valutazione del rispetto sostanziale della regola, dato che in questa materia la credibilità nei confronti di noi stessi e del mondo è un requisito essenziale. Sarà anche necessario attuare rapidamente l'armonizzazione dei bilanci delle amministrazioni pubbliche. Opportunamente la proposta di legge in discussione in Parlamento già prevede l'assegnazione allo Stato della potestà legislativa esclusiva in materia di armonizzazione dei bilanci pubblici. Nell'immediato daremo piena attuazione alle manovre varate nel corso dell'estate, completandole attraverso interventi in linea con la lettera di intenti inviata alle autorità europee.
 
Nel corso delle prossime settimane valuteremo la necessità di ulteriori correttivi. Una parte significativa della correzione dei saldi programmata durante l'estate è attesa dall'attuazione della riforma dei sistemi fiscale ed assistenziale. Dovremmo pervenire al più presto ad una definizione di tale riforma e ad una valutazione prudenziale dei suoi effetti. Dovranno inoltre essere identificati gli interventi, volti a colmare l'eventuale divario rispetto a quelli indicati nella manovra di bilancio.
 
Di fronte ai sacrifici che sono stati e che dovranno essere richiesti ai cittadini sono ineludibili interventi volti a contenere i costi di funzionamento degli organi elettivi. I soggetti che ricoprono cariche elettive, i dirigenti designati politicamente nelle società di diritto privato, finanziate con risorse pubbliche, più in generale quanti rappresentano le istituzioni ad ogni livello politico ed amministrativo, dovranno agire con sobrietà ed attenzione al contenimento dei costi, dando un segnale concreto ed immediato. Si dovranno rafforzare gli interventi effettuati con le ultime manovre di finanza pubblica, con l'obiettivo di allinearci rapidamente alle best practices europee.
 
Per quanto di mia diretta competenza, avvierò immediatamente una spending review del Fondo unico della Presidenza del Consiglio. Ritengo inoltre necessario ridurre le sovrapposizioni tra i livelli decisionali e favorire la gestione integrata dei servizi per gli Enti locali di minori dimensioni. Il riordino delle competenze delle Province può essere disposto con legge ordinaria. La prevista specifica modifica della Costituzione potrà completare il processo, consentendone la completa eliminazione, così come prevedono gli impegni presi con l'Europa.

Per garantire la natura strutturale della riduzione delle spese dei Ministeri, decisa con la legge di stabilità, andrà definito rapidamente il programma per la riorganizzazione della spesa, previsto dalla legge 14 settembre 2011, n. 148, in particolare per quanto riguarda l'integrazione operativa delle agenzie fiscali, la razionalizzazione di tutte le strutture periferiche dell'amministrazione dello Stato, il coordinamento delle attività delle forze dell'ordine, l'accorpamento degli enti della previdenza pubblica, la razionalizzazione dell'organizzazione giudiziaria.
 
Gli interventi saranno coordinati con la spending review in corso, che intendo rafforzare e rendere particolarmente incisiva con la precisa individuazione di tempi e responsabilità. Negli scorsi anni la normativa previdenziale è stata oggetto di ripetuti interventi, che hanno reso a regime il sistema pensionistico italiano tra i più sostenibili in Europa e tra i più capaci di assorbire eventuali shock negativi. Già adesso l'età di pensionamento, nel caso di vecchiaia, tenendo conto delle cosiddette finestre, è superiore a quella dei lavoratori tedeschi e francesi.
 
Il nostro sistema pensionistico rimane però caratterizzato da ampie disparità di trattamento tra diverse generazioni e categorie di lavoratori, nonché da aree ingiustificate di privilegio.
 
Il rispetto delle regole e delle istituzioni e la lotta all'illegalità riceveranno attenzione prioritaria da questo Governo. Per riacquistare fiducia nel futuro dobbiamo avere fiducia nelle istituzioni che caratterizzano uno Stato di diritto, quindi si procederà alla lotta all'evasione fiscale e all'illegalità, non solo per aumentare il gettito (il che non guasta), ma anche per abbattere le aliquote: questo può essere fatto con efficacia prestando particolare attenzione al monitoraggio della ricchezza accumulata (ho detto monitoraggio della ricchezza accumulata) e non solo ai redditi prodotti.
 
L'evasione fiscale continua a essere un fenomeno rilevante: il valore aggiunto sommerso è quantificato nelle statistiche ufficiali in quasi un quinto del prodotto. Interventi incisivi in questo campo possono ridurre il peso dell'aggiustamento sui contribuenti che rispettano le norme. Occorre ulteriormente abbassare la soglia per l'uso del contante, favorire un maggior uso della moneta elettronica, accelerare la condivisione delle informazioni tra le diverse amministrazioni, potenziare e rendere operativi gli strumenti di misurazione induttiva del reddito e migliorare la qualità degli accertamenti.
 
Il decreto legislativo n. 23 del 14 marzo 2011 prevede per il 2014 l'entrata in vigore dell'imposta municipale che assorbirà l'attuale ICI, escludendo tuttavia la prima casa e l'IRPEF sui redditi fondiari da immobili non locati, comprese le relative addizionali. In questa cornice intendiamo riesaminare il peso del prelievo sulla ricchezza immobiliare: tra i principali Paesi europei, l'Italia è caratterizzata da un'imposizione sulla proprietà immobiliare che risulta al confronto particolarmente bassa. L'esenzione dall'ICI delle abitazioni principali costituisce, sempre nel confronto internazionale, una peculiarità - se non vogliamo chiamarla anomalia - del nostro ordinamento tributario.
 
Il primo elenco di cespiti immobiliari da avviare a dismissione sarà definito nei tempi previsti dalla legge di stabilità, cioè entro il 30 aprile 2012. La lettera d'intenti inviata alla Commissione europea prevede proventi di almeno 5 miliardi all'anno nel prossimo triennio. A tale scopo verrà definito un calendario puntuale per i successivi passi del piano di dismissioni e di valorizzazione del patrimonio pubblico. Tuttavia, è necessario volgere tutte le politiche pubbliche, a livello macroeconomico e microeconomico, a sostegno della crescita, sia pure nei limiti determinati dal vincolo di bilancio.
 
La pressione fiscale in Italia è elevata nel confronto storico e in quello internazionale (nel testo scritto che avrete a disposizione si danno ulteriori elementi). Nel tempo e via via che si manifesteranno gli effetti della spending review sarà possibile programmare una graduale riduzione della pressione fiscale; tuttavia anche prima, a parità di gettito, la composizione del prelievo fiscale può essere modificata in modo da renderla più favorevole alla crescita. Coerentemente con il disegno della delega fiscale e della clausola di salvaguardia che la accompagna, una riduzione del peso delle imposte e dei contributi che gravano sul lavoro e sull'attività produttiva, finanziata da un aumento del prelievo sui consumi e sulla proprietà, sosterrebbe la crescita senza incidere sul bilancio pubblico.

Dal lato della spesa, un impulso all'attività economica potrà derivare da un aumento del coinvolgimento dei capitali privati nella realizzazione di infrastrutture. Gli incentivi fiscali stabiliti con legge di stabilità sono un primo passo, ma è anche necessario intervenire sulla regolamentazione del project financing, in modo da ridurre il rischio associato alle procedure amministrative. Occorre inoltre operare per raggiungere gli obiettivi fissati in sede europea con l'agenda digitale. Ho quasi concluso.
 
Con il consenso delle parti sociali dovranno essere riformate le istituzioni del mercato del lavoro, per allontanarci da un mercato duale dove alcuni sono fin troppo tutelati mentre altri sono totalmente privi di tutele e assicurazioni in caso di disoccupazione.


Le riforme in questo campo dovranno avere il duplice scopo di rendere più equo il nostro sistema di tutela del lavoro e di sicurezza sociale e anche di facilitare la crescita della produttività, tenendo conto dell'eterogeneità che contraddistingue in particolare l'economia italiana. In ogni caso, il nuovo ordinamento che andrà disegnato verrà applicato ai nuovi rapporti di lavoro per offrire loro una disciplina veramente universale, mentre non verranno modificati i rapporti di lavori regolari e stabili in essere.

Intendiamo perseguire lo spostamento del baricentro della contrattazione collettiva verso i luoghi di lavoro, come ci viene chiesto dalle autorità europee e come già le parti sociali hanno iniziato a fare, che va accompagnato da una disciplina coerente del sostegno alle persone senza impiego volta a facilitare la mobilità e il reinserimento nel mercato del lavoro, superando l'attuale segmentazione. Più mobilità tra impresa e settori è condizione essenziale per assecondare la trasformazione dell'economia italiana e sospingerne la crescita.
 
È necessario colmare il fossato che si è creato tra le garanzie e i vantaggi offerti dal ricorso ai contratti a termine e ai contratti a tempo indeterminato, superando i rischi e le incertezze che scoraggiano le imprese a ricorrere a questi ultimi. Tenendo conto dei vincoli di bilancio occorre avviare una riforma sistematica degli ammortizzatori sociali, volta a garantire a ogni lavoratore che non sarà privo di copertura rispetto ai rischi di perdita temporanea del posto di lavoro. Abbiamo da affrontare una crisi, abbiamo da affrontare delle trasformazioni strutturali, ma è nostro dovere cercare di evitare le angosce che accompagnano questi processi.


È necessario, infine, mantenere una pressione costante nell'azione di contrasto e di prevenzione del lavoro sommerso. Uno dei fattori che distinguono l'Italia nel contesto europeo è la maggiore difficoltà di inserimento o di permanenza in condizioni di occupazione delle donne. Assicurare la piena inclusione delle donne in ogni ambito della vita lavorativa ma anche sociale e civile del Paese è una questione indifferibile.
 
È necessario affrontare le questioni che riguardano la conciliazione della vita familiare con il lavoro, la promozione della natalità e la condivisione delle responsabilità legate alla maternità da parte di entrambi i genitori, nonché studiare l'opportunità di una tassazione preferenziale per le donne.
 
C'è poi un problema legato all'invecchiamento della popolazione che si traduce in oneri crescenti per le famiglie; andrà quindi prestata attenzioni ai servizi di cura agli anziani, oggi una preoccupazione sempre più urgente nelle famiglie in un momento in cui affrontano difficoltà crescenti.


Infine un'attenzione particolare andrà assicurata alle prospettive per i giovani; dico infine nel senso di finalità di tutta la nostra azione. Questa sarà una delle priorità di azione di questo Governo, nella convinzione che ciò che restringe le opportunità per i giovani si traduce poi in minori opportunità di crescita e di mobilità sociale per l'intero Paese. Dobbiamo porci l'obiettivo di eliminare tutti quei vincoli che oggi impediscono ai giovani di strutturare le proprie potenzialità in base al merito individuale indipendentemente dalla situazione sociale di partenza. Per questo ritengo importante inserire nell'azione di Governo misure che valorizzino le capacità individuali e eliminino ogni forma di cooptazione. L'Italia ha bisogno di investire sui suoi talenti; deve essere lei orgogliosa dei suoi talenti e non trasformarsi in un'entità di cui i suoi talenti non sempre sono orgogliosi. Per questo la mobilità è la nostra migliore alleata, mobilità sociale ma anche geografica, non solo all'interno del nostro Paese ma anche e soprattutto nel più ampio orizzonte del mercato del lavoro europeo e globale.
 
L'ultimo punto che desidero brevemente presentarvi - ed è una caratteristica spero distintiva del nostro Esecutivo, se consentirete al nostro, o vostro, Governo di nascere, è quella delle politiche micro-economiche per la crescita.
 
Un ritorno credibile a più alti tassi di crescita deve basarsi su misure volte a innalzare il capitale umano e fisico e la produttività dei fattori. La valorizzazione del capitale umano deve essere un aspetto centrale: sarà necessario mirare all'accrescimento dei livelli d'istruzione della forza lavoro, che sono ancora oggi nettamente inferiori alla media europea, anche tra i più giovani. Vi contribuiranno interventi mirati sulle scuole e sulle aree in ritardo, identificando i fabbisogni, anche mediante i test elaborati dall'INVALSI, e la revisione del sistema di selezione, allocazione e valorizzazione degli insegnanti. Nell'università, varati i decreti attuativi della legge di riforma approvata lo scorso anno, è ora necessario dare rapida e rigorosa attuazione ai meccanismi d'incentivazione basati sulla valutazione, previsti dalla riforma. Gli investimenti in infrastrutture, di cui tante volte e giustamente abbiamo parlato e si è parlato negli corso degli anni, sono fattori rilevanti per accrescere la produttività totale dell'economia.
 
A questo scopo, abbiamo per la prima volta valorizzato in modo organico nella struttura del Governo la politica, anzi, le politiche di sviluppo dell'economia reale, con l'attribuzione ad un unico Ministro delle competenze sullo sviluppo economico e sulle infrastrutture ed i trasporti. Questo vuole indicare quasi visivamente e in termini di organigramma del Governo che pari attenzione e centralità vanno attribuite a ciò che mantiene il Paese stabile, la disciplina finanziaria, e a ciò che ad esso consente di crescere e, quindi, di restare stabile a lungo termine, cioè appunto la crescita.
 
Occorre anche rimuovere gli ostacoli strutturali alla crescita, affrontando resistenze e chiusure corporative. In tal senso, è necessario un disegno organico, volto a ridurre gli oneri ed il rischio associato alle procedure amministrative, nonché a stimolare la concorrenza, con particolare riferimento al riordino della disciplina delle professioni regolamentate, anche dando attuazione a quanto previsto nella legge di stabilità in materia di tariffe minime.
 
Intendiamo anche rafforzare gli strumenti d'intervento dell'Autorità garante della concorrenza e del mercato in caso di disposizioni legislative o amministrative, statali o locali, che abbiano effetti distorsivi della concorrenza, accrescere la qualità dei servizi pubblici, nel quadro di un'azione volta a ridurre il deficit di concorrenza a livello locale, ridurre i tempi della giustizia civile, in modo tale da colmare il divario con gli altri Paesi, anche attraverso la riduzione delle sedi giudiziarie, e rimuovere gli ostacoli alla crescita delle dimensioni delle imprese, anche attraverso la delega fiscale.
 
Un innalzamento significativo del tasso di crescita è condizione essenziale non solo del riequilibrio finanziario, ma anche del progresso civile e sociale. In tal senso, una strategia di rilancio della crescita non può prescindere da un'azione determinata ed efficace di contrasto alla criminalità organizzata e a tutte le mafie, che vada a colpire gli interessi economici delle organizzazioni e le loro infiltrazioni nell'economia legale.


Il risanamento della finanza pubblica ed il rilancio della crescita contribuiranno a rafforzare la posizione dell'Italia in Europa e, più in generale, la nostra politica estera: vocazione europeistica, solidarietà atlantica, rapporti con i nostri partners strategici, apertura dei mercati, sicurezza nazionale ed internazionale rimarranno i cardini di tale politica. Voglio qui ricordare i nostri militari impegnati in missioni all'estero, le Forze Armate ed i rappresentanti delle forze dell'ordine, che sono in prima linea nella difesa dei nostri valori e della democrazia.

L'Italia ha bisogno di una politica estera coerente con i nostri impegni e di una ripresa d'iniziativa nelle aree dove vi siano significativi interessi nazionali.
 
Dimenticavo di dirvi, a proposito di militari impegnati in missioni all'estero, che se non vedete ancora in questi banchi il nostro collega Ministro della difesa, è perché l'altra sera l'ho svegliato alle tre di notte in Afghanistan, pensando che fosse a Bruxelles dove si trova la sua sede ordinaria di lavoro. Ho notato prima una certa esitazione e poi grande entusiasmo nell'accettazione della proposta. (Applausi dai Gruppi PdL e PD). Ecco un esempio di militare impegnato all'estero che sta facendo i salti mortali per arrivare a giurare nelle mani del Capo dello Stato nelle prossime ore. Scusate quindi la sua assenza.
 
La gravità della situazione attuale richiede una risposta pronta e decisa nella creazione di condizioni favorevoli alla crescita nel perseguimento del pareggio di bilancio, con interventi strutturali e con un'equa distribuzione dei sacrifici.
 
Il tentativo che ci proponiamo di compiere, onorevoli senatori, e che vi chiedo di sostenere è difficilissimo; altrimenti ho il sospetto che non mi troverei qui oggi. I margini di successo sono tanto più ridotti, come ha rilevato il Presidente della Repubblica, dopo anni di contrapposizione e di scontri nella politica nazionale. Se sapremo cogliere insieme questa opportunità per avviare un confronto costruttivo su scelte e obiettivi di fondo avremo occasione di riscattare il Paese e potremo ristabilire la fiducia nelle sue istituzioni. Vi ringrazio.")


Draghi_disco<-c("Il primo pensiero che vorrei condividere, nel chiedere la vostra fiducia, riguarda la nostra responsabilità nazionale. Il principale dovere cui siamo chiamati, tutti, io per primo come presidente del Consiglio, è di combattere con ogni mezzo la pandemia e di salvaguardare le vite dei nostri concittadini. Una trincea dove combattiamo tutti insieme. Il virus è nemico di tutti. Ed è nel commosso ricordo di chi non c'è più che cresce il nostro impegno. Prima di illustrarvi il mio programma, vorrei rivolgere un altro pensiero, partecipato e solidale, a tutti coloro che soffrono per la crisi economica che la pandemia ha scatenato, a coloro che lavorano nelle attività più colpite o fermate per motivi sanitari. Conosciamo le loro ragioni, siamo consci del loro enorme sacrificio e li ringraziamo. Ci impegniamo a fare di tutto perché possano tornare, nel più breve tempo possibile, nel riconoscimento dei loro diritti, alla normalità delle loro occupazioni. Ci impegniamo a informare i cittadini con sufficiente anticipo, per quanto compatibile con la rapida evoluzione della pandemia, di ogni cambiamento nelle regole.
l Governo farà le riforme ma affronterà anche l'emergenza. Non esiste un prima e un dopo. Siamo consci dell'insegnamento di Cavour:... le riforme compiute a tempo, invece di indebolire l'autorità, la rafforzano. Ma nel frattempo dobbiamo occuparci di chi soffre adesso, di chi oggi perde il lavoro o è costretto a chiudere la propria attività.

Nel ringraziare, ancora una volta il presidente della Repubblica per l'onore dell'incarico che mi è stato assegnato, vorrei dirvi che non vi è mai stato, nella mia lunga vita professionale, un momento di emozione così intensa e di responsabilità così ampia. Ringrazio altresì il mio predecessore Giuseppe Conte che ha affrontato una situazione di emergenza sanitaria ed economica come mai era accaduto dall'Unità d'Italia.  

Si è discusso molto sulla natura di questo governo. La storia repubblicana ha dispensato una varietà infinita di formule. Nel rispetto che tutti abbiamo per le istituzioni e per il corretto funzionamento di una democrazia rappresentativa, un esecutivo come quello che ho l'onore di presiedere, specialmente in una situazione drammatica come quella che stiamo vivendo, è semplicemente il governo del Paese. Non ha bisogno di alcun aggettivo che lo definisca. Riassume la volontà, la consapevolezza, il senso di responsabilità delle forze politiche che lo sostengono alle quali è stata chiesta una rinuncia per il bene di tutti, dei propri elettori come degli elettori di altri schieramenti, anche dell'opposizione, dei cittadini italiani tutti. Questo è lo spirito repubblicano di un governo che nasce in una situazione di emergenza raccogliendo l'alta indicazione del capo dello Stato.
                
                La crescita di un'economia di un Paese non scaturisce solo da fattori economici. Dipende dalle istituzioni, dalla fiducia dei cittadini verso di esse, dalla condivisione di valori e di speranze. Gli stessi fattori determinano il progresso di un Paese.

Si è detto e scritto che questo governo è stato reso necessario dal fallimento della politica. Mi sia consentito di non essere d'accordo. Nessuno fa un passo indietro rispetto alla propria identità ma semmai, in un nuovo e del tutto inconsueto perimetro di collaborazione, ne fa uno avanti nel rispondere alle necessità del Paese, nell'avvicinarsi ai problemi quotidiani delle famiglie e delle imprese che ben sanno quando è il momento di lavorare insieme, senza pregiudizi e rivalità.

Nei momenti più difficili della nostra storia, l'espressione più alta e nobile della politica si è tradotta in scelte coraggiose, in visioni che fino a un attimo prima sembravano impossibili. Perché prima di ogni nostra appartenenza, viene il dovere della cittadinanza.
                
                Siamo cittadini di un Paese che ci chiede di fare tutto il possibile, senza perdere tempo, senza lesinare anche il più piccolo sforzo, per combattere la pandemia e contrastare la crisi economica. E noi oggi, politici e tecnici che formano questo nuovo esecutivo siamo tutti semplicemente cittadini italiani, onorati di servire il proprio Paese, tutti ugualmente consapevoli del compito che ci è stato affidato.
                
                Questo è lo spirito repubblicano del mio governo.
                
                La durata dei governi in Italia è stata mediamente breve ma ciò non ha impedito, in momenti anche drammatici della vita della nazione, di compiere scelte decisive per il futuro dei nostri figli e nipoti. Conta la qualità delle decisioni, conta il coraggio delle visioni, non contano i giorni. Il tempo del potere può essere sprecato anche nella sola preoccupazione di conservarlo. Oggi noi abbiamo, come accadde ai governi dell'immediato Dopoguerra, la possibilità, o meglio la responsabilità, di avviare una Nuova Ricostruzione. L'Italia si risollevò dal disastro della Seconda Guerra Mondiale con orgoglio e determinazione e mise le basi del miracolo economico grazie a investimenti e lavoro. Ma soprattutto grazie alla convinzione che il futuro delle generazioni successive sarebbe stato migliore per tutti. Nella fiducia reciproca, nella fratellanza nazionale, nel perseguimento di un riscatto civico e morale. A quella Ricostruzione collaborarono forze politiche ideologicamente lontane se non contrapposte. Sono certo che anche a questa Nuova Ricostruzione nessuno farà mancare, nella distinzione di ruoli e identità, il proprio apporto. Questa è la nostra missione di italiani: consegnare un Paese migliore e più giusto ai figli e ai nipoti.
                
                Spesso mi sono chiesto se noi, e mi riferisco prima di tutto alla mia generazione, abbiamo fatto e stiamo facendo per loro tutto quello che i nostri nonni e padri fecero per noi, sacrificandosi oltre misura. È una domanda che ci dobbiamo porre quando non facciamo tutto il necessario per promuovere al meglio il capitale umano, la formazione, la scuola, l'università e la cultura. Una domanda alla quale dobbiamo dare risposte concrete e urgenti quando deludiamo i nostri giovani costringendoli ad emigrare da un paese che troppo spesso non sa valutare il merito e non ha ancora realizzato una effettiva parità di genere. Una domanda che non possiamo eludere quando  aumentiamo il nostro debito pubblico senza aver speso e investito al meglio risorse che sono sempre scarse. Ogni spreco oggi è un torto che facciamo alle prossime generazioni, una sottrazione dei loro diritti. Esprimo davanti a voi, che siete i rappresentanti eletti degli italiani, l'auspicio che il desiderio e la necessità di costruire un futuro migliore orientino saggiamente le nostre decisioni. Nella speranza che i giovani italiani che prenderanno il nostro posto, anche qui in questa aula, ci ringrazino per il nostro lavoro e non abbiano di che rimproverarci per il nostro egoismo.
                
                Questo governo nasce nel solco dell'appartenenza del nostro Paese, come socio fondatore, all'Unione europea, e come protagonista dell'Alleanza Atlantica, nel solco delle grandi democrazie occidentali, a difesa dei loro irrinunciabili principi e valori.  Sostenere questo governo significa condividere l'irreversibilità della scelta dell'euro, significa condividere la prospettiva di un'Unione Europea sempre più integrata che approderà a un bilancio pubblico comune capace di sostenere i Paesi nei periodi di recessione. Gli Stati nazionali rimangono il riferimento dei nostri cittadini, ma nelle aree definite dalla loro debolezza cedono sovranità nazionale per acquistare sovranità condivisa. Anzi, nell'appartenenza convinta al destino dell'Europa siamo ancora più italiani, ancora più vicini ai nostri territori di origine o residenza. Dobbiamo essere orgogliosi del contributo italiano alla crescita e allo sviluppo dell'Unione europea. Senza l'Italia non c'è l'Europa. Ma, fuori dall'Europa c'è meno Italia. Non c'è sovranità nella solitudine. C'è solo l'inganno di ciò che siamo, nell'oblio di ciò che siamo stati e nella negazione di quello che potremmo essere. Siamo una grande potenza economica e culturale. Mi sono sempre stupito e un po' addolorato in questi anni, nel notare come spesso il giudizio degli altri sul nostro Paese sia migliore del nostro. Dobbiamo essere più orgogliosi, più giusti e più generosi nei confronti del nostro Paese. E riconoscere i tanti primati, la profonda ricchezza del nostro capitale sociale, del nostro volontariato, che altri ci invidiano.

Da quando è esplosa l'epidemia, ci sono stati -- i dati ufficiali sottostimano il fenomeno -- 92.522 morti, 2.725.106 cittadini colpiti dal virus, in questo momento 2.074 sono i ricoverati in terapia intensiva. Ci sono 259 morti tra gli operatori sanitari e 118.856 sono quelli contagiati, a dimostrazione di un enorme sacrificio sostenuto con generosità e impegno. Cifre che hanno messo a dura prova il sistema sanitario nazionale, sottraendo personale e risorse alla prevenzione e alla cura di altre patologie, con conseguenze pesanti sulla salute di tanti italiani.
                
                L'aspettativa di vita, a causa della pandemia, è diminuita: fino a 4 - 5 anni nelle zone di maggior contagio; un anno e mezzo - due in meno per tutta la popolazione italiana. Un calo simile non si registrava in Italia dai tempi delle due guerre mondiali.

La diffusione del virus ha comportato gravissime conseguenze anche sul tessuto economico e sociale del nostro Paese. Con rilevanti impatti sull'occupazione, specialmente quella dei giovani e delle donne. Un fenomeno destinato ad aggravarsi quando verrà meno il divieto di licenziamento.
                
                Si è anche aggravata la povertà. I dati dei centri di ascolto Caritas, che confrontano il periodo maggio-settembre del 2019 con lo stesso periodo del 2020, mostrano che da un anno all'altro l'incidenza dei nuovi poveri passa dal 31% al 45%: quasi una persona su due che oggi si rivolge alla Caritas lo fa per la prima volta. Tra i nuovi poveri aumenta in particolare il peso delle famiglie con minori, delle donne, dei giovani, degli italiani, che sono oggi la maggioranza (52% rispetto al 47,9 % dello scorso anno) e delle persone in età lavorativa, di fasce di cittadini finora mai sfiorati dall'indigenza.

Il numero totale di ore di Cassa integrazione per emergenza sanitaria dal 1 aprile al 31 dicembre dello scorso anno supera i 4 milioni. Nel 2020 gli occupati sono scesi di 444 mila unità ma il calo si è accentrato su contratti a termine (-393 mila) e lavoratori autonomi (-209). La pandemia ha finora ha colpito soprattutto giovani e donne, una disoccupazione selettiva ma che presto potrebbe iniziare a colpire anche i lavoratori con contratti  a tempo indeterminato.

Gravi e con pochi precedent storici gli effetti sulla diseguaglianza. In assenza di interventi pubblici il coefficiente di Gini, una misura della diseguaglianza nella distribuzione del reddito, sarebbe aumentato, nel primo semestre del 2020 (secondo una recente stima), di 4 punti percentuali, rispetto al 34.8% del 2019. Questo aumento sarebbe stato maggiore di quello cumulato durante le due recenti recessioni. L'aumento nella diseguaglianza è stato tuttavia attenuato dalle reti di protezione presenti nel nostro sistema di sicurezza sociale, in particolare dai provvedimenti che dall'inizio della pandemia li hanno rafforzati. Rimane però il fatto che il nostro sistema di sicurezza sociale è squilibrato, non proteggendo a sufficienza i cittadini con impieghi a tempo determinato e i lavoratori autonomi.

Le previsioni pubblicate la scorsa settimana dalla Commissione europea indicano che sebbene nel 2020 la recessione europea sia stata meno grave di quanto ci si aspettasse -- e che quindi già fra poco più di un anno si dovrebbero recuperare i livelli di attività economica pre-pandemia - in Italia questo non accadrà prima della fine del 2022, in un contesto in cui, prima della pandemia, non avevamo ancora recuperato pienamente gli effetti delle crisi del 2008-09 e del 2011-13.

La diffusione del Covid ha provocato ferite profonde nelle nostre comunità, non solo sul piano sanitario ed economico, ma anche su quello culturale ed educativo. Le ragazze e i ragazzi hanno avuto, soprattutto quelli nelle scuole secondarie di secondo grado, il servizio scolastico attraverso la Didattica a Distanza che, pur garantendo la continuità del servizio, non può non creare disagi ed evidenziare diseguaglianze. Un dato chiarisce meglio la dinamica attuale: a fronte di 1.696.300 studenti delle scuole secondarie di secondo grado, nella prima settimana di febbraio solo 1.039.372 studenti (il 61,2% del totale) ha avuto assicurato il servizio attraverso la Didattica a Distanza.

Questa situazione di emergenza senza precedenti impone di imboccare, con decisione e rapidità, una strada di unità e di impegno comune.

Il piano di vaccinazione. Gli scienziati in soli 12 mesi hanno fatto un miracolo: non era mai accaduto che si riuscisse a produrre un nuovo vaccino in meno di un anno. La nostra prima sfida è, ottenutene le quantità sufficienti, distribuirlo rapidamente ed efficientemente.

Abbiamo bisogno di mobilitare tutte le energie su cui possiamo contare, ricorrendo alla protezione civile, alle forze armate, ai tanti volontari. Non dobbiamo limitare le vaccinazioni all'interno di luoghi specifici, spesso ancora non pronti: abbiamo il dovere di renderle possibili in tutte le strutture disponibili, pubbliche e private. Facendo tesoro dell'esperienza fatta con i tamponi che, dopo un ritardo iniziale, sono stati permessi anche al di fuori della ristretta cerchia di ospedali autorizzati. E soprattutto imparando da Paesi che si sono mossi più rapidamente di noi disponendo subito di quantità di vaccini adeguate. La velocità è essenziale non solo per proteggere gli individui e le loro comunità sociali, ma ora anche per ridurre le possibilità che sorgano altre varianti del virus.

Sulla base dell'esperienza dei mesi scorsi dobbiamo aprire un confronto a tutto campo sulla riforma della nostra sanità. Il punto centrale è rafforzare e ridisegnare la sanità territoriale, realizzando una forte rete di servizi di base (case della comunità, ospedali di comunità, consultori, centri di salute mentale, centri di prossimità contro la povertà sanitaria). È questa la strada per rendere realmente esigibili i Livelli essenziali di assistenza e affidare agli ospedali le esigenze sanitarie acute, post acute e riabilitative. La casa come principale luogo di cura è oggi possibile con la telemedicina, con l'assistenza domiciliare integrata.

La scuola: non solo dobbiamo tornare rapidamente a un orario scolastico normale, anche distribuendolo su diverse fasce orarie, ma dobbiamo fare il possibile, con le modalità più adatte, per recuperare le ore di didattica in presenza perse lo scorso anno, soprattutto nelle regioni del Mezzogiorno in cui la didattica a distanza ha incontrato maggiori difficoltà.

Occorre rivedere il disegno del percorso scolastico annuale. Allineare il calendario scolastico alle esigenze derivanti dall'esperienza vissuta dall'inizio della pandemia. Il ritorno a scuola deve avvenire in sicurezza.

È necessario investire in una transizione culturale a partire dal patrimonio identitario umanistico riconosciuto a livello internazionale. Siamo chiamati disegnare un percorso educativo che combini la necessaria adesione agli standard qualitativi richiesti, anche nel panorama europeo, con innesti di nuove materie e metodologie, e coniugare le competenze scientifiche con quelle delle aree umanistiche e del multilinguismo.

Infine è necessario investire nella formazione del personale docente per allineare l'offerta educativa alla domanda delle nuove generazioni.
                
                In questa prospettiva particolare attenzione va riservata agli ITIS (istituti tecnici). In Francia e in Germania, ad esempio, questi istituti sono un pilastro importante del sistema educativo. E' stato stimato in circa 3 milioni, nel quinquennio 2019-23, il fabbisogno di diplomati di istituti tecnici nell'area digitale e ambientale. Il Programma Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza assegna 1,5 md agli ITIS, 20 volte il finanziamento di un anno normale pre-pandemia. Senza innovare l'attuale organizzazione di queste scuole, rischiamo che quelle risorse vengano sprecate.

La globalizzazione, la trasformazione digitale e la transizione ecologica stanno da anni cambiando il mercato del lavoro e richiedono continui adeguamenti nella formazione universitaria. Allo stesso tempo occorre investire adeguatamente nella ricerca, senza escludere la ricerca di base, puntando all'eccellenza, ovvero a una ricerca riconosciuta a livello internazionale per l'impatto che produce sulla nuova conoscenza e sui nuovi modelli in tutti i campi scientifici. Occorre infine costruire sull'esperienza di didattica a distanza maturata nello scorso anno sviluppandone le potenzialità con l'impiego di strumenti digitali che potranno essere utilizzati nella didattica in presenza.

Quando usciremo, e usciremo, dalla pandemia, che mondo troveremo? Alcuni pensano che la tragedia nella quale abbiamo vissuto per più di 12 mesi sia stata simile ad una lunga interruzione di corrente. Prima o poi la luce ritorna, e tutto ricomincia come prima. La scienza, ma semplicemente il buon senso, suggeriscono che potrebbe non essere così.

Il riscaldamento del pianeta ha effetti diretti sulle nostre vite e sulla nostra salute, dall'inquinamento, alla fragilità idrogeologica, all'innalzamento del livelllo dei mari che potrebbe rendere ampie zone di alcune città litoranee non più abitabili. Lo spazio che alcune megalopoli hanno sottratto alla natura potrebbe essere stata una delle cause della trasmissione del virus dagli animali all'uomo.
                
                Come ha detto papa Francesco Le tragedie naturali sono la risposta della terra al nostro maltrattamento. E io penso che se chiedessi al Signore che cosa pensa, non credo mi direbbe che è una cosa buona: siamo stati noi a rovinare l'opera del Signore.
                
                Proteggere il futuro dell ambiente, conciliandolo con il progresso e il benessere sociale, richiede un approccio nuovo: digitalizzazione,  agricoltura, salute, energia, aerospazio, cloud computing, scuole ed educazione, protezione dei territori , biodiversità, riscaldamento globale ed effetto serra, sono diverse facce di una sfida poliedrica che vede al centro l ecosistema in cui si svilupperanno tutte le azioni umane.
                
                Anche nel nostro Paese alcuni modelli di crescita dovranno cambiare. Ad esempio il modello di turismo, un attività  che prima della pandemia rappresentava il 14 per cento del totale delle nostre attività economiche. Imprese e lavoratori in quel settore vanno aiutati ad uscire dal disastro creato dalla pandemia. Ma senza scordare che il nostro turismo avrà un futuro se non dimentichiamo che esso vive della nostra capacità di preservare, cioè almeno non sciupare, città d'arte, luoghi e tradizioni che successive generazioni attraverso molti secoli hanno saputo preservare e ci hanno tramandato.
                
                Uscire dalla pandemia non sarà come riaccendere la luce. Questa osservazione, che gli scienziati non smettono di ripeterci, ha una conseguenza importante. Il governo dovrà proteggere i lavoratori, tutti i lavoratori, ma sarebbe un errore proteggere indifferentemente tutte le attività economiche. Acune dovranno cambiare, anche radicalmente. E la scelta di quali attività proteggere e quali accompagnare nel cambiamento è il difficile compito che la politica economica dovrà affrontare nei prossimi mesi.
                
                La capacità di adattamento del nostro sistema produttivo e interventi senza precedenti hanno permesso di preservare la forza lavoro in un anno drammatico: sono stati sette milioni i lavoratori che hanno fruito di strumenti di integrazione salariale per un totale di 4 miliardi di ore. Grazie a tali misure, supportate anche dalla Commissione Europea mediante il programma SURE, è stato possibile limitare gli effetti negativi sull'occupazione. A pagare il prezzo più alto sono stati i giovani, le donne e i lavoratori autonomi. E' innanzitutto a loro che bisogna pensare quando approntiamo una strategia di sostegno delle imprese e del lavoro, strategia che dovrà coordinare la sequenza degli interventi sul lavoro, sul credito e sul capitale.
                
                Centrali sono le politiche attive del lavoro. Affinché esse siano immediatamente operative è necessario migliorare gli strumenti esistenti, come l'assegno di riallocazione, rafforzando le politiche di formazione dei lavoratori occupati e disoccupati. Vanno anche rafforzate le dotazioni di personale e digitali dei centri per l'impiego in accordo con le regioni. Questo progetto è già parte del Programma Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza ma andrà anticipato da subito.
                
                Il cambiamento climatico, come la pandemia, penalizza alcuni settori produttivi senza che vi sia un'espansione in altri settori che possa compensare. Dobbiamo quindi essere noi ad assicurare questa espansione e lo dobbiamo fare subito.

La risposta della politica economica al cambiamento climatico e alla pandemia dovrà essere una combinazione di politiche strutturali che facilitino l'innovazione, di politiche finanziarie che facilitino l'accesso delle imprese capaci di crescere al capitale e al credito e di politiche monetarie e fiscali espansive che agevolino gli investimenti e creino domanda per le nuove attività sostenibili che sono state create.

Vogliamo lasciare un buon pianeta, non solo una buona moneta.

La mobilitazione di tutte le energie del Paese nel suo rilancio non può prescindere dal coinvolgimento delle donne. Il divario di genere nei tassi di occupazione in Italia rimane tra i più alti di Europa: circa 18 punti su una media europea di 10. Dal dopoguerra ad oggi, la situazione è notevolmente migliorata, ma questo incremento non è andato di pari passo con un altrettanto evidente miglioramento delle condizioni di carriera delle donne. L'Italia presenta oggi uno dei peggiori gap salariali tra generi in Europa, oltre una cronica scarsità di donne in posizioni manageriali di rilievo.
                
                Una vera parità di genere non significa un farisaico rispetto di quote rosa richieste dalla legge: richiede che siano garantite parità di condizioni competitive tra generi. Intendiamo lavorare in questo senso, puntando a un riequilibrio del gap salariale e un sistema di welfare che permetta alle donne di dedicare alla loro carriera le stesse energie dei loro colleghi uomini, superando la scelta tra famiglia o lavoro.
                
                Garantire parità di condizioni competitive significa anche assicurarsi che tutti abbiano eguale accesso alla formazione di quelle competenze chiave che sempre più permetteranno di fare carriera - digitali, tecnologiche e ambientali. Intendiamo quindi investire, economicamente ma soprattutto culturalmente, perché sempre più giovani donne scelgano di formarsi negli ambiti su cui intendiamo rilanciare il Paese. Solo in questo modo riusciremo a garantire che le migliori risorse siano coinvolte nello sviluppo del Paese.
                
                Aumento dell'occupazione, in primis, femminile, è obiettivo imprescindibile: benessere, autodeterminazione, legalità, sicurezza sono strettamente legati all'aumento dell'occupazione femminile nel Mezzogiorno. Sviluppare la capacità di attrarre investimenti privati nazionali e internazionali è essenziale per generare reddito, creare lavoro, investire il declino demografico e lo spopolamento delle aree interne. Ma per raggiungere questo obiettivo occorre creare un ambiente dove legalità e sicurezza siano sempre garantite. Vi sono poi strumenti specifici quali il credito d'imposta e altri interventi da concordare in sede europea.
                
                Per riuscire a spendere e spendere bene, utilizzando gli investimenti dedicati dal Next Generation EU occorre irrobustire le amministrazioni meridionali, anche guardando con attenzione all'esperienza di un passato che spesso ha deluso la speranza.


In tema di infrastrutture occorre investire sulla preparazione tecnica, legale ed economica dei funzionari pubblici per permettere alle amministrazioni di poter pianificare, progettare ed accelerare gli investimenti con certezza dei tempi, dei costi e in piena compatibilità con gli indirizzi di sostenibilità e crescita indicati nel Programma nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza. Particolare attenzione va posta agli investimenti in manutenzione delle opere e nella tutela del territorio, incoraggiando l'utilizzo di tecniche predittive basate sui più recenti sviluppi in tema di Intelligenza artificiale e tecnologie digitali. Il settore privato deve essere invitato a partecipare alla realizzazione degli investimenti pubblici apportando più che finanza, competenza, efficienza e innovazione per accelerare la realizzazione dei progetti nel rispetto dei costi previsti.
                
                
                La strategia per i progetti del Next Generation EU non può che essere trasversale e sinergica, basata sul principio dei co-benefici, cioè con la capacità di impattare simultaneamente più settori, in maniera coordinata. 
                
                Dovremo imparare a prevenire piuttosto che a riparare,  non solo  dispiegando tutte le  tecnologie a nostra disposizione ma anche investendo sulla consapevolezza  delle nuove generazioni che ogni azione ha una conseguenza.
                
                Come si è ripetuto più volte, avremo a disposizione circa 210 miliardi lungo un periodo di sei anni.
                
                Queste risorse dovranno essere spese puntando a migliorare il potenziale di crescita della nostra economia. La quota di prestiti aggiuntivi che richiederemo tramite la principale componente del programma, lo Strumento per la ripresa e resilienza, dovrà essere modulata in base agli obiettivi di finanza pubblica.
                
                Il precedente Governo ha già svolto una grande mole di lavoro sul Programma di ripresa e resilienza (PNRR). Dobbiamo approfondire e completare quel lavoro che, includendo le necessarie interlocuzioni con la Commissione Europea, avrebbe una scadenza molto ravvicinata, la fine di aprile.
                
                Gli orientamenti che il Parlamento esprimerà nei prossimi giorni a commento della bozza di Programma presentata dal Governo uscente saranno di importanza fondamentale nella preparazione della sua versione finale. Voglio qui riassumere l'orientamento del nuovo Governo.

Le Missioni del Programma potranno essere rimodulate e riaccorpate, ma resteranno quelle enunciate nei precedenti documenti del Governo uscente, ovvero l'innovazione, la digitalizzazione, la competitività e la cultura; la transizione ecologica; le infrastrutture per la mobilità sostenibile; la formazione e la ricerca; l'equità sociale, di genere, generazionale e territoriale; la salute e la relativa filiera produttiva.

Dovremo rafforzare il Programma prima di tutto per quanto riguarda gli obiettivi strategici e le riforme che li accompagnano.

Il Programma è finora stato costruito in base ad obiettivi di alto livello e aggregando proposte progettuali in missioni, componenti e linee progettuali. Nelle prossime settimane rafforzeremo la dimensione strategica del Programma, in particolare con riguardo agli obiettivi riguardanti la produzione di energia da fonti rinnovabili, l'inquinamento dell'aria e delle acque, la rete ferroviaria veloce, le reti di distribuzione dell'energia per i veicoli a propulsione elettrica, la produzione e distribuzione di idrogeno, la digitalizzazione, la banda larga e le reti di comunicazione 5G.
                
                Il ruolo dello Stato e il perimetro dei suoi interventi dovranno essere valutati con attenzione. Compito dello dello Stato è utilizzare le leve della spesa per ricerca e sviluppo, dell'istruzione e della formazione, della regolamentazione, dell'incentivazione e della tassazione.
                
                In base a tale visione strategica, il Programma nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza indicherà obiettivi per il prossimo decennio e più a lungo termine, con una tappa intermedia per l'anno finale del Next Generation EU, il 2026. Non basterà elencare progetti che si vogliono completare nei prossimi anni. Dovremo dire dove vogliamo arrivare nel 2026 e a cosa puntiamo per il 2030 e il 2050, anno in cui l'Unione Europea intende arrivare a zero emissioni nette di CO2 e gas clima-alteranti.
                
                Selezioneremo progetti e iniziative coerenti con gli obiettivi strategici del Programma, prestando grande attenzione alla loro fattibilità nell'arco dei sei anni del programma. Assicureremo inoltre che l'impulso occupazionale del Programma sia sufficientemente elevato in ciascuno dei sei anni, compreso il 2021.
                
                Chiariremo il ruolo del terzo settore e del contributo dei privati al Programma Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza attraverso i meccanismi di finanziamento a leva (fondo dei fondi).
                
                Sottolineeremo il ruolo della scuola che tanta parte ha negli obiettivi di coesione sociale e territoriale e quella dedicata all'inclusione sociale e alle politiche attive del lavoro

Nella sanità dovremo usare questi progetti per porre le basi, come indicato sopra, per rafforzare la medicina territoriale e la telemedicina.

La governance del Programma di ripresa e resilienza è incardinata nel Ministero dell'Economia e Finanza con la strettissima collaborazione dei Ministeri competenti che definiscono le politiche e i progetti di settore. Il Parlamento verrà costantemente informato sia sull'impianto complessivo, sia sulle politiche di settore.

Infine il capitolo delle riforme che affronterò ora separatamente.


Il Next generation EU prevede riforme.

Alcune riguardano problemi aperti da decenni ma che non per questo vanno dimenticati. Fra questi la certezza delle norme e dei piani di investimento pubblico, fattori che limitano gli investimenti, sia italiani che esteri. inoltre la concorrenza: chiederò all'Autorità garante per la concorrenza e il mercato, di produrre in tempi brevi come previsto dalla Legge Annuale sulla Concorrenza (Legge 23 luglio 2009, n. 99) le sue proposte in questo campo.
                
                Negli anni recenti i nostri tentativi di riformare il paese non sono stati del tutto assenti, ma i loro effetti concreti sono stati limitati. Il problema sta forse nel modo in cui spesso abbiamo disegnato le riforme: con interventi parziali dettati dall'urgenza del momento, senza una visione a tutto campo che richiede tempo e competenza. Nel caso del fisco, per fare un esempio, non bisogna dimenticare che il sistema tributario è un meccanismo complesso, le cui parti si legano una all'altra. Non è una buona idea cambiare le tasse una alla volta. Un intervento complessivo rende anche più difficile che specifici gruppi di pressione riescano a spingere il governo ad adottare misure scritte per avvantaggiarli.
                
                Inoltre, le esperienze di altri paesi insegnano che le riforme della tassazione dovrebbero essere affidate a esperti, che conoscono bene cosa può accadere se si cambia un'imposta. Ad esempio la Danimarca, nel 2008, nominò una Commissione di esperti in materia fiscale. La Commissione incontrò i partiti politici e le parti sociali e solo dopo presentò la sua relazione al Parlamento. Il progetto prevedeva un taglio della pressione fiscale pari a 2 punti di Pil. L'aliquota marginale massima dell'imposta sul reddito veniva ridotta, mentre la soglia di esenzione veniva alzata.

Un metodo simile fu seguito in Italia all'inizio degli anni Settanta del secolo scorso quando il governo affidò ad una commissione di esperti, fra i quali Bruno Visentini e Cesare Cosciani, il compito di ridisegnare il nostro sistema tributario, che non era stato più modificato dai tempi della riforma Vanoni del 1951. Si deve a quella commissione l'introduzione dell'imposta sul reddito delle persone fisiche e del sostituto d'imposta per i redditi da lavoro dipendente. Una riforma fiscale segna in ogni Paese un passaggio decisivo. Indica priorità, dà certezze, offre opportunità, è l'architrave della politica di bilancio
                
                In questa prospettiva va studiata una revisione profonda dell'Irpef con il duplice obiettivo di semplificare e razionalizzare la struttura del prelievo, riducendo gradualmente il carico fiscale e preservando la progressività. Funzionale al perseguimento di questi ambiziosi obiettivi sarà anche un rinnovato e rafforzato impegno nell'azione di contrasto all'evasione fiscale.

L'altra riforma che non si può procrastinare è quella della pubblica amministrazione. Nell'emergenza l'azione amministrativa, a livello centrale e nelle strutture locali e periferiche, ha dimostrato capacità di resilienza e di adattamento grazie a un impegno diffuso nel lavoro a distanza e a un uso intelligente delle tecnologie a sua disposizione. La fragilità del sistema delle pubbliche amministrazioni e dei servizi di interesse collettivo è, tuttavia, una realtà che deve essere rapidamente affrontata.
                
                Particolarmente urgente è lo smaltimento dell'arretrato accumulato durante la pandemia. Agli uffici verrà chiesto di predisporre un piano di smaltimento dell'arretrato e comunicarlo ai cittadini
                
                La riforma dovrà muoversi su due direttive: investimenti in connettività con anche la realizzazione di piattaforme efficienti e di facile utilizzo da parte dei cittadini; aggiornamento continuo delle competenze dei dipendenti pubblici, anche selezionando nelle assunzioni le migliori competenze e attitudini in modo rapido, efficiente e sicuro, senza costringere a lunghissime attese decine di migliaia di candidati.
                
                Nel campo della giustizia le azioni da svolgere sono principalmente quelle che si collocano all'interno del contesto e delle aspettative dell'Unione europea. Nelle Country Specific Recommendations indirizzate al nostro Paese negli anni 2019 e 2020, la Commissione, pur dando atto dei progressi compiuti negli ultimi anni, ci esorta: ad aumentare l'efficienza del sistema giudiziario civile, attuando e favorendo l'applicazione dei decreti di riforma in materia di insolvenza, garantendo un funzionamento più efficiente dei tribunali, favorendo lo smaltimento dell'arretrato e una migliore gestione dei carichi di lavoro, adottando norme procedurali più semplici, coprendo i posti vacanti del personale amministrativo, riducendo le differenze che sussistono nella gestione dei casi da tribunale a tribunale e infine favorendo la repressione della corruzione.

Nei nostri rapporti internazionali questo governo sarà convintamente europeista e atlantista, in linea con gli ancoraggi storici dell'Italia: Unione europea, Alleanza Atlantica, Nazioni Unite. Ancoraggi che abbiamo scelto fin dal dopoguerra, in un percorso che ha portato benessere, sicurezza e prestigio internazionale. Profonda è la nostra vocazione a favore di un multilateralismo efficace, fondato sul ruolo insostituibile delle Nazioni Unite. Resta forte la nostra attenzione e proiezione verso le aree di naturale interesse prioritario, come i Balcani, il Mediterraneo allargato, con particolare attenzione alla Libia e al Mediterraneo orientale, e all'Africa.

Gli anni più recenti hanno visto una spinta crescente alla costruzione in Europa di reti di rapporti bilaterali e plurilaterali privilegiati. Proprio la pandemia ha rivelato la necessità di perseguire uno scambio più intenso con i partner con i quali la nostra economia è più integrata. Per l'Italia ciò comporterà la necessità di meglio strutturare e rafforzare il rapporto strategico e imprescindibile con Francia e Germania. Ma occorrerà anche consolidare la collaborazione con Stati con i quali siamo accomunati da una specifica sensibilità mediterranea e dalla condivisione di problematiche come quella ambientale e migratoria: Spagna, Grecia, Malta e Cipro. Continueremo anche a operare affinché si avvii un dialogo più virtuoso tra l'Unione europea e la Turchia, partner e alleato Nato.

L'Italia si adopererà per alimentare meccanismi di dialogo con la Federazione Russa. Seguiamo con preoccupazione ciò che sta accadendo in questo e in altri paesi dove i diritti dei cittadini sono spesso violati. Seguiamo anche con preoccupazione l'aumento delle tensioni in Asia intorno alla Cina.

Altra sfida sarà il negoziato sul nuovo Patto per le migrazioni e l'asilo, nel quale perseguiremo un deciso rafforzamento dell'equilibrio tra responsabilità dei Paesi di primo ingresso e solidarietà effettiva. Cruciale sarà anche la costruzione di una politica europea dei rimpatri dei non aventi diritto alla protezione internazionale, accanto al pieno rispetto dei diritti dei rifugiati.

L'avvento della nuova Amministrazione USA prospetta un cambiamento di metodo, più cooperativo nei confronti dell'Europa e degli alleati tradizionali. Sono fiducioso che i nostri rapporti e la nostra collaborazione non potranno che intesificarsi.

Dal dicembre scorso e fino alla fine del 2021, l'Italia esercita per la prima volta la Presidenza del G20. Il programma, che coinvolgerà l'intera compagine governativa, ruota intorno a tre pilastri: People, Planet, Prosperity. L'Italia avrà la responsabilità di guidare il Gruppo verso l'uscita dalla pandemia, e di rilanciare una crescita verde e sostenibile a beneficio di tutti. Si tratterà di ricostruire e di ricostruire meglio.

Insieme al Regno Unito - con cui quest'anno abbiamo le Presidenze parallele del G7 e del G20 - punteremo sulla sostenibilità e la transizione verde nella prospettiva della prossima Conferenza delle Parti sul cambiamento climatico (Cop 26), con una particolare attenzione a coinvolgere attivamente le giovani generazioni, attraverso l'evento Youth4Climate.

Questo è il terzo governo della legislatura. Non c'è nulla che faccia pensare che possa far bene senza il sostegno convinto di questo Parlamento. E' un sostegno che non poggia su alchimie politiche ma sullo spirito di sacrificio con cui donne e uomini hanno affrontato l'ultimo anno, sul loro vibrante desiderio di rinascere, di tornare più forti e sull'entusiasmo dei giovani che vogliono un paese capace di realizzare i loro sogni. Oggi, l'unità non è un'opzione, l'unità è un dovere. Ma è un dovere guidato da ciò che son certo ci unisce tutti: l'amore per l'Italia.")

ggplot(Monti_freq, aes(x = reorder(WORD, -FREQ), y = FREQ)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "cadetblue3") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  xlab("Terms") + ylab("Freq")+ 
  labs(title = "Frequent Terms in discourse by Monti")
```
In Monti's inaugural speech the shadow of the global debt crisis was vividly present in many of the top-used words; "growth" was by far the most pronounced word and the entire speech was pervaded by references to the economic situation and the urge to actively intervene on it with specific policies: "job", "necessary" and "intervention" are among the highest ranking words.
Monti already prefigured the kind of operations that his government would have had to perform and the general need of austerity and focus on taxation and fiscal policies: "crisis", "fiscal", and "budget" ("bilancio").

```{r text draghi, results = TRUE}
ggplot(Draghi_freq, aes(x = reorder(WORD, -FREQ), y = FREQ)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkblue") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  xlab("Terms") + ylab("Freq")+ 
  labs(title = "Frequent Terms in discourse by Draghi")
```

The situation of urgency emerges with similar clearance from Monti's speech too,"dobbiamo" ("we must") is an example, but the most interesting aspect shown by this graph is in our opinion the idea of a specific direction for Italy in the words "program", and "European". 
Draghi seems to be interested in making clear Italy's position within a renewed European framework and pronounces many times words related to the most discussed issues of the last period, "pandemics" of course, but also "women", "jobs" and citizenship.
