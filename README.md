## About the project

This is the Capstone project of Nicola Destro, Lorenzo Sioli and Tomas Ruzza, for the course *Data Access and Regulation, Module II*
With a focus on the last Italian government crisis, the purpose of our project was to provide an overview about italian political instability and technocracies (in Italy and in Europe).

The original goal was to create a sort of "definitive guide" about Italian government crisis, also because the literature on this topic was fewer and, at times, more contradictory than one would expect.

Such analysis ended up being just a beginning of our work which we developed in four different phases:

-italian government crisis
-technocracies in Europe
-perception of the italian situation in foreign newspapers
-comparison between the speeches of Mario Monti and Mario Draghi

## Personal goals

Our final work contains a variety of charts and visualization tools. Our main interest was in fact to experiment and have fun in the highest possible number of ways with R.
We had to approach many different datasets and situations and we learnt a lot from the difficulties  we encountered.
The Capstone Project was for us a first an important chance to challenge ourselves and discover practically the application of our new set of skills and knowledge.
