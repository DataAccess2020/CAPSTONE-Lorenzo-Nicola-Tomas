The objective for our Capstone Project was to, starting from last Italian government crisis, have a sort of overview about technocracies in Italy and in Europe. The original goal was to create a sort of "definitive guide" about the numbers of Italian's crisis, often discordant between each other. This analysis became out starting point to analyze the impact of technocracy in Italy, comparing it between other technocratic governments in Europe. After that, we decided to compared Mario Monti's and Mario Draghi's inaugural speech in senate to give a sight at the situation that make this kind of government necessary.

We took inspiration from several works that are further explained in the report and among which we can find.
